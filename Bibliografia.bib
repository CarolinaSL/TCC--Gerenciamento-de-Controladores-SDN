journal="Journal of Network and Systems Management",

abstract="Since the emergence of software defined networking (SDN) and from the development of the OpenFlow protocol, it is possible to observe that this new paradigm of networks is revolutionizing the networks based on the IP protocol, allowing the creation of new mechanisms for provisioning of services, guaranteeing scalability and reducing costs. Although this new paradigm has been created for the centralization of the control logic, it is possible to decentralize it. In this scenario, subdividing the administrative domain into smaller subdomains and having each subdomain controlled by a controller has been an alternative to ensure scalability in SDN. This article proposes an architecture, here called OrchFlow, capable of receiving requests from applications and orchestrating them in order to provide the requested services in an OpenFlow network with multiple controllers. OrchFlow acts hierarchically and provides access to the network infrastructure in three distinct ways: Proactive, Reactive, and Hybrid. This article presents the architecture, implementation, and an extensive benchmarking using two of today's leading OpenFlow controllers, Ryu and Floodlight.",

While SDN is promoting many new network applications, security has become an important concern. This paper provides an extensive survey on SDN security. We discuss the security threats to SDN according to their effects, i.e., Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. We also review a wide range of SDN security controls, such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, access control, auditing, and policy management. We describe several pathways of how SDN is evolving."

abstract = "Network usage and demands are growing at a rapid pace, while the network administrators are facing difficulties in tracking the frequent users’ access of the network. Consequently, managing the infrastructure supporting these demands has become a complicated and time-consuming task. Networks are also in a flux state, they are not only expanding but require reconfigurations to meet the business needs. Software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies have emerged as promising solutions that change the cost profile and agility of internet protocol (IP) networks. Conceptually, SDN separates the network control logic from its underlying hardware, enabling network administrators to exert more control over network functioning and providing a unified global view of the network. However, SDN and NFV can be merged and have the potential to mitigate the challenges of legacy networks. In this paper, our aim is to describe the benefits of using SDN in a multitude of environments such as in data centers, data center networks, and Network as Service offerings. We also present the various challenges facing SDN, from scalability to reliability and security concerns, and discuss existing solutions to these challenges."

abstract = "Network services underpin operator revenues, and value-added services provide income beyond core (voice and data) infrastructure capability. Today, operators face multiple challenges: a need to innovate and offer a wider choice of value-added services, whilst increasing network scale, bandwidth and flexibility. They must also reduce operational costs, and deploy services far faster - in minutes rather than days or weeks. In the recent years, the network community, motivated by the aforementioned challenges, has developed production network architectures and seeded technologies, like Software Defined Networking, Application-based Network Operations and Network Function Virtualization. These technologies enhance the highly desired properties for elasticity, agility and cost-effectiveness in the operator environment. A key requirement to fully exploit the benefits of these new architectures and technologies is a fundamental shift in management and control of resources, and the ability to orchestrate the network infrastructure: coordinate the instantiation of high-level network services across different technological domains and automate service deployment and re-optimization. This paper surveys existing standardization efforts for the orchestration - automation, coordination, and management - of complex set of network and function resources (both physical and virtual), and highlights the various enabling technologies, strengths and weaknesses, adoption challenges for operators, and areas where further research is required."
